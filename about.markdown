I am Kartik. I live in Singapore.  

I needed a way to keep track of software development over time â€“ whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.
